# KeyValueDataProcessor (IP3)

This project was developed as part of my Big Data Analytics coursework (CS356).  
It simulates a basic **key-value processing system** inspired by MapReduce-style architecture.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Assignment**: Individual Project 3 (IP3)
- **Goal**: Create a simulated key-value program to process data in chunks
- **Language**: Python
- **IDE Used**: Spyder (via Anaconda)

## 🧠 Features

- Custom key-value logic for parsing and aggregating data
- Simulated chunk-based data processing
- Clear separation of logic for ingestion, transformation, and output
- Well-documented and commented code

## 📁 Files Included

- `IP3.py`: Main Python program implementing the key-value logic
- `IP3-Python Key-Value Program.docx`: Written report detailing the architecture and use case

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project:
1. Open the file `IP3.py` in **Spyder**
2. Ensure Python 3.x and pandas are installed
3. Execute and observe output in chunks
